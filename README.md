For this this project, I built a 2-tier web application (Flask + MySQL) that deploys on an AWS EC2 instance. The deployment is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose. A full CI/CD pipeline is established using Jenkins to automate the build and deployment process whenever new code is pushed to a GitHub repository
